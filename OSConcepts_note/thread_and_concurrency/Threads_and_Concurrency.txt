CHAPTER 4 Threads & Concurrency

		4.1	Overview

4.1.1 Motivation

4.1.2 Benefits
Multi-threaded program can distribute its work to threads.
When a thread is doing time-consuming job,
single-threaded program stops working and wait until job's done.


When the server makes a connection with a client, there's two options.
One is to create a process and the other is to create a thread.
In general, creating process consumes time and memory more.
Processes must use message passing and shared memory to share its resources.
However, threads living in a process shares resources of the process.
Latter doesn't need to allocate additional memory and make resource sharing logic by programmer.


Contemporary computers have multiple cores.
Single-threaded program which can utilize only one core has limited performance.

		4.2 Multicore Programming

4.2.1 Programming Challenges
1. Identifying Tasks
	what tasks are seperable?
2. Balance
	equal work per equal value

3. Data splitting

4. Data dependency

5. Testing and Debugging
	parallel execution makes debugging hard.

4.2.2 Types of Parallelism
1. Data parallelism

2. Task parallelism

		4.3 Multithreading Models

User threads and Kernel threads
4.3.1 Many-to-One Model
	many user threads to one kernel thread
	waits blocking system call
	bad for multiprocessing computers
	green-thread library was adopted in early versions of Java.

4.3.2 One-to-One Model
	one user thread to one kernel threads
	don't wait blocking system call
	many user thread leads to many kernel threads that costs a lot.
	number of user threads may be limited.
	Linux, Windows family

4.3.3 Many-to-Many Model
	user threads >= kernel threads
	multiplexed threads
	it allows to create many user threads regardless of kernel threads.
	limiting kernel threads are less efficient when many cores are given.
	contemporay concurrency library

		4.4 Thread Libraried

There are two types of the library.
User space and Kernel space library.
invoking function in former doesn't invoke system call.

Windows, Java, Pthreads(Posix thread)
Pthread: user-level or kernel-level library
Windows: kernel-level library
Java: Java program -> JVM -> host system, global data has to be explicitly arranged by threads.

asynchronous threading
	parent thread and child thread execute independantly. used in responsive UI, multithreaded server.
	little data sharing
synchronous threading
	parent thread waits child threads to finish the work. it may combine the results from child threads.
	significant amount of data sharing

4.4.1 Pthreads
pthread_t
pthread_attr_t

int		pthread_attr_init(pthread_attr_t *attr)
int		pthread_create
(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_rountine)(void *), void (arg))
void	pthread_exit(void *value_ptr)
int		pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **value_ptr)

		4.5 Implicit Threading

4.5.1 Thread Pools
4.5.2 Fork join
4.5.3 OpenMP
	brew install libomp
	-Xclang -fopenmp -lomp -L/User/hseong/.brew/lib
4.5.4 GCD (Grand Central Dispatch)
	man dispatch
	#include <dispatch/dispatch.h>
4.5.5 TBB (Thread Building Block)

		4.6 Threading Issues

4.6.1 The fork() and exec() system calls
if the intend of fork() call is to create another process with exec(),
threads on the parent process don't need to be copied.
if it is to duplicate current process, copy of the threads on the parent process is necessary.

4.6.2 Signal handling
synchronous signal
asynchronous signal

4.6.3 Thread cancellation
asynchronous cancellation
deferred cancellation

4.6.4 Thread-local storage (TLS)
pthread_key_create
pthread_spespecific

4.6.5 Scheduler Activation
Light Weight Process(LWP) is used in Many-to-many model and two level model.
it appears as virtual processor where the application can be schedule a user thread to run.
each of them attach to a kernel thread.

a thread meets blocking call
-> kernel send upcall to upcall handler of thread library.
-> upcall handler pause the blocked thread and take virtual processor
-> the upcall handler assign new virtual processor to user thread eligible to run.
-> when event which break blocking happens, kernel send upcall and blocked thread is now eligible to run.
-> after marking the unblocked thread eligible to run, the application schedules an eligible thread
	to run on an available virtual processor.

		4.7 Operating-System Examples

4.7.1 Windows Threads
ETHREAD	- executive thread block
KTHREAD - kernel thread block
TEB - thread environment block

4.7.2 Linux Threads
