C is dangerous as much as strong

exact use of increment(decrement) operator which is either postfix or prefix.
	ft_memchr
watch size_t(or unsigned types) variable -1 overflow
	ft_memchr
where to put index increment(decrement) operation in loop.

keep in mind the constness of string in string manipulation function.
	ft_split
decide a valid range of variables, or decide the range causing UB.
	every functions...
analyize original testcases if possible, and results of the execution.
	ft_memmove
be careful when length of string is related.
	ft_memmove	ft_strncmp
if there is no information when implementing a non-standard function,
find similar functions in other languages.
	ft_substr	ft_strtrim
