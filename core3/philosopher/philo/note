date races
	message		(inconsistent time order)
	timestamp	(value overlapping causes infinite loop)
	timestamp	(thread and mutex destroy, main thread locked on the thread's mutex)

odd number of threads need more time and take more time until finish

frequent use of mutex causes slowing down monitoring loop.

a monitor thread dosen't work well when there're hundreds of threads.
