if input is given in stdin withoug newline, function doesn't end.

one of the edge case conditions was missing. then edge case should be handled properly.

mistaken operator precedence between + and ==.

used a value as a EOF flag which is changed in the middle so that unexpected behavior happens.

variables which are almost same (i.e, when their difference is one or zero) can be misused.
problem caused by subtle difference between them was hard to debug. 
when newline is included in buffer, actually copied characters = length to newline,
stored length = length to character right before newline.
there must be two variable used as length and newline flag (or length and newline included length).

*trivial*
if you fix variable error, make sure to fix every occurences of the variable.

dereferencing failure(SIGSEGV) occured when immediate return is necessary but delayed.
over-simplifying can result those things.

side effects of modifying a word to resolve a problem can be produce bigger problem.
